Project: prodemy. <br>
Main page was wrote in Laravel for SEO optimisation. <br>
Project looks great both on desktops and on mobiles. <br>
Uses: <br>
<ul>
<li>Laravel as a backend framework</li>
<li>React as the best frontend library</li>
<li>Redux as the most popular state manager</li>
<li>Saga to intercept actions :)</li>
<li>React Router as the best solution for navigation in react SPA</li>
<li>React Player to make work with videos much conveniently</li>
<li>React Slick to make cool slides on page</li>
<li>Moment to don`t worry about time :)</li>
<li>Pusher as a great service for messaging</li>
</ul>
Also I`ve used SASS for convenience) <br>
I wrote this SPA myself from design to deploy.

Prodemy is my first full-scale project.
